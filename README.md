### About

The purpose of this tutorial is to inform someone about the basics of computer hardware and how they are interconnected. It will explain, in general terms, how the main components of a computer work and how they work in conjunction  with other components. The knowledge provided can be used to understand both PCs and laptops, but this guide does focus on components that may not be present in laptops.


**Target audience:** The target audience for this project is anyone who has a basic understanding of technology and has used a computer before. This tutorial is for all ages, but some level of foundational understanding of what a computer is and what it does is necessary. Prior use of computers is highly suggested. 

Some parts of this guide do give explanations on what to pick when building a computer, but this guide is not for someone who wishes to build a PC. This guide is for anyone who wants to understand how computers components work and why some may be favorable over another.

### Build and Laptop Purchase Suggestion

Three main things to consider when building a PC or choosing a laptop:
- purpose
- price
- compatibility

You want to consider purpose because it will determine how expensive of components you need. You must consider price because you cannot build a computer with money you do not have. Finally, you must consider part compatibility. There are some parts that would work great for what you need, but that does not guarantee each part will work with each other. I suggest using the website [PC PartPicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) to add your components and check their compatibility. 

This guide explains what each part does, but it does not specifically denote what to buy for specific purposes. The exact parts a person should buy is dependent on what they need and their financial situation, so I did not suggest specific parts.

A lot of what is discussed in this guide can be used to understand laptops. In fact, most of the section where I explain if something is different in a laptop versus PC. Hopefully, this guide will allow the reader to understand how laptop components work.

### Build Strategy
Not sure where to start when picking parts?

I usually start at the purpose of the build. I ask questions like: What [software](software.md) do you want to run? What OS do you want?

From there, I choose the [motherboard](motherboard.md) and therefore choose [CPU](cpu.md) type. I choose the specific CPU I want, and I considered the cooling strategy. Then, I choose the [GPU](gpu.md) and [RAM](memory.md) based on the specifications of the motherboard and the purpose of the build. Next, I choose the [PSU](psu.md) as all the other should have a combined total wattage that I can then use to determine the scale of my PSU. Then I choose the [storage](storage.md) and the [cooling](cooler.md) and I check to make sure that there is enough clearance in the potential build. Cooling is chosen around this time to ensure that cooling can properly cool all the heat generating components. Since all the internals are decided, I choose the [case](case.md) next. The case depends upon the size of the motherboard, PSU, and cooling systems. While choosing the case, I also consider [peripherals](peripherals.md) and their ability to attach to the case.
