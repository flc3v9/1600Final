### What is a Case?
A case is the outer layer of the computer. It is essentially the computer's skin as it protects the computer from the outside, and is the main point of contact between the computer and the outside. All peripherals are connected to the case, not the computer. 

Laptops do not have cases but rather shells or bodies that hold all the components together. Laptop shells are not customizable beyond putting stickers on the lid or putting a protective case and customizing the case. Laptop shells do act similarly to a PC case as they are the main point of contact between anything connecting to the internals of the computer. Like a PC case, you still have to plug in peripherals and power sources to the outside of the shell that is connected to the motherboard. 

## How to choose a case
Choosing the case can be one of the more simple choices when building a computer, but this depends on person to person. The main thing to consider is the computer's form factor. This was discussed in the [motherboard](motherboard.md) article, but the main thing to know about form factor is that it dictates the size of the motherboard. Depending on the size of the motherboard, you can fit your computer into smaller or larger cases. For example, the micro-ATX can fit into smaller cases that the ATX cannot. The micro-ATX can also fit into the larger ATX cases if more room is needed.

### Case Size Classifications
There are three main classifications of case sizes:
- mini towers
- mid towers
- full towers

The size difference is exactly as it sounds. The main point of having these different sizes is to fit the different motherboards with the least amount of spacee. The mini-ITX cases are the smallest, being around half the size of a mid tower case while the micro-ATX cases are slightly larger. As such, a mini-ITX motherboard can fit into a micro-ATX or larger case, but nothing but a mini-ITX build can fit into a mini-ITX case.

Why would you want to put a smaller build into a larger case?  
Sometimes the components you chose will not fit into the case. This happens a lot when you have to include numerous fans for cooling in conjunction with a large power supply. In this case, it is often better to size up to ensure cooling occurs. As mentioned in the motherboard article, people who get the mini-ITX or micro-ATX are often not looking for a computer than can do everything that a larger motherboard can provide for them. Thus, the smaller cases work for these forms since larger airflow or cooling is usually not needed.

### Understanding Connections
When building a PC, it is just as vital to understand what you want connected outside of your main computer as to understand what you want inside your main computer. The external components, often called [peripherals](peripherals.md), are something that have to be considered for their compatibility with computer hardware and whether or not there are enough slots on the case to plug these all in.

For example, say your case has 4 USB ports and one power port. You currently have one external hard drive, keyboard, mouse, camera, and microphone that all have USB connectors that you want to plug into your computer. The issue is here is that you do not have enough ports on the case to plug all of these in. Thus, it is important to consider the amount of ports that the case has when buying a case. That said, this problem can be easily fixed by getting a USB hub of some sort that allows multiple connctions to one port.

Another thing to consider is *port type* and *port speed*. Port type is the type of port that the case has, whether it is USB, USB-C, Ethernet, HDMI, etc. When you buy a case, be conscious of what connectors your peripherals use and what your case has. You can easily mitigate this by having converters, but this can affect port speed. Port speed is the speed at which a certain amount of data is transferred over the period of a second. There are different generations of USB that have faster or slower speeds. It is important to considert this because a faster speed will be bottlenecked by a slower speed. Basically, choose a case that can match or be faster than the speed of the peripherals. Otherwise, you should look for slower peripherals.


### Cable Management
Finally, the most important thing to consider about cases is cable management. When you build your computer, you do not want all the internal wires to be haphazardly thrown in the case. Why? Because if there is an issue with the hardware, it will be extremely hard to untangle them and figure out the problem.

Having a larger case will allow for better space when managing cables, but, if you assemble your computer smartly, the case size should not hinder cable management. 

The best way to cable manage is to group similar cables or cables that end up going the same way together via velcro straps or some form of tether. This allows for the eyes to easily track where the cables are going and what they are doing.

Likewise, this is dependent upon a logical set up. You should take care to place your components in a way that makes sense and allows for room for cooling and cable management.
