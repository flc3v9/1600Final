### What is a CPU?
A CPU is a computer's processor. It executes the instructions given to it by a computer program. These instructions are ofteen logic, arithmetic, and input/output operations. 

It is connected to the [motherboard](motherboard.md) by connection to the northbridge of the chipset. The motherboard determines the chipset, so be careful to choose a compatible CPU and motherboard.

## CPU Terminology

### Cores
You might have heard of cores, and a simple definition of a CPU core is a single unit of processing that exeuctes instructions. When you think of a CPU, you might think of it as one thing that does many tasks. In reality, a CPU is a group of cores that can handle tasks or parts of instructions to make a working, multi-tasking computer. The more cores a CPU has, the more processing power it has. In other words, the more cores mean the more tasks your computer can complete simultaneously.

Both laptops and PCs have various CPUs to choose from. The difference is that the laptop has a preset of components that you have to get alongside your preferred CPU while a PC allows you to pick out each component individually to min-max your PC.

### Clock speeds
Another term you might have heard of in relation to CPU is clock speed. Clock speed is the number of cycles a CPU can perform in a second. A cycle generally known as the most basic unit of measurement of a CPU's speed. This is all measured by very specific electronic hardware measuring that I will not get into here. Essentially, a higher clock speed is a faster CPU as the CPU can process tasks faster with a higher clock speed.

This brings me to **overlocking**. Overclocking is when you forcefully increase the processor clock speed beyond what it is meant to perform at. This results in better performance by the computer as it runs the CPU as fast as possible. This is useful if you bought a CPU that does not have the clocking speeds to run the software you want it to run as effectively as you need it to. You can force the CPU to run beyond what it was made to in order to produce the results you want. The biggest issue with this is that overclocking *greatly* increases the temperature of your CPU which can lead to long-term damage that will erode the CPU if not maintained properly. Laptop manufacturers often lock the laptop's CPU in order to prevent overclocking as laptops are not as easily cooled as PCs and can lead to serious injury or destruction of the laptop.


## CPU Types: AMD vs Intel
If you know anything about computers or CPU, you have probably heard of Intel and AMD. Intel and AMD are companies that both produce many products, but mainly known for their CPUs.

### What is the difference?
There is a long standing argument in the computer community about which processor type is better. Intel CPUs have a strong reputation of great high performance in gaming and media production while AMD CPUs are known for their great price point and power efficientcy. Intel's biggest drawbacks are the combination of their initial buy price and the extreme power consumption, and AMD's biggest drawbacks are the significant amount of heat the CPU produces and the incompatability with peripherals.

In general, which CPU brand you go with depends upon what you want the computer to do and how much you are willing to spend for this performance. For laptops, whatever laptop brand you choose will determine which processor you get. Some companies give you choices depending on which model laptop you are buying (ex. Surface laptops), but most processors are predetermined. 

### Cooling
One of the most important things to consider with CPUs is [cooling](cooler.md). Some computer setups have dedicated CPU coolers alongside full computer cooling. Some CPUs have cooling included. You will need to check on the type of cooling you want to give your CPU as CPU cooling is vital to a long lasting computer. Laptops have some built in cooling, but laptop CPU cooling is not customizable.
